# Extest (Extension Testing)

Extest is a PHP extension for testing PHP internals. Currently there are two parts:

* PHP Compatibility ([PHPC](https://github.com/bukka/phpc)) api test that is implemented in [extest_compat.c](extest_compat.c)
* [Testing new internal serialization API](doc/serialize.md) that is currently outdated and disabled.
